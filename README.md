- 👋 Hi, I’m @faeisanxious on the internet and Adrian IRL.
- :blush: About me: I'm a CS student from Poland; interested in computer programming in general and programming / making embedded ("IoT") systems; as well as building and analyzing electrical circuits for those embedded systems.
- ✍️ Mainly working with C++ / C
   <br>In the future I'd like to explore more of: programming embedded systems, high performance applications, making my own embedded systems and of course continue my journey with general computer programming.
- :evergreen_tree: Besides all the tech'y stuff I really enjoy spending my time in and around nature!
- 🌱 I’m currently focusing on learning C++, Rust and electrical / computer / digital systems engineering
