- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @feyisanxious on the internet and Adrian (or Ria) IRL.
- :blush: About me: I'm a CS student from Poland; interested in computer programming in general (mostly in C++ / C) and programming microcontrolers (C / C++) as well as building electrical circuits for those Î¼C's.
   <br>In the future I'd like to explore more of: programming embedded systems, interfacing Î¼C with PC programs, high performance applications, learn to make my own embedded systems (and maybe robots :eyes:) and of course continue my journey with general computer programming.
- :evergreen_tree: Besides all the tech'y stuff I really enjoy spending my time in and around nature!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing on learning C++, C and electrical / computer / digital systems engineering
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? Discord: feyisnaxious#2673; email: adrianzabax@gmail.com
