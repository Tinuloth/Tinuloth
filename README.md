- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @feyisanxious on the internet and Adrian (or Ria) IRL.
- :blush: About me: I'm a CS student from Poland, I'm interested in C++, C, computer programming in general and programming microcontrolers (like Arduino).
   <br>In the future I'd like to explore programming embedded systems, learn to make my own embedded systems and maybe robots :eyes: and of course continue my journey with computer programming.
   <br>:evergreen_tree: Besides all the tech'y stuff I really enjoy spending my time in and around nature!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ & C
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? Discord: feyisnaxious#2673; email: adrianzabax@gmail.com
