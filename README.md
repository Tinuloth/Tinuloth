- 👋 Hi, I’m @faeisanxious on the internet and Adrian (or Ria) IRL.
- :blush: About me: I'm a CS student from Poland; interested in computer programming in general and programming microcontrollers / making embedded systems; as well as building and analyzing electrical circuits for those μC's.
- ✍️ Mainly working with C and C++
   <br>In the future I'd like to explore more of: programming embedded systems, interfacing μC with PC programs, high performance applications, making my own embedded systems and of course continue my journey with general computer programming.
- :evergreen_tree: Besides all the tech'y stuff I really enjoy spending my time in and around nature!
- 🌱 I’m currently focusing on learning C++, C and electrical / computer / digital systems engineering
- 📫 How to reach me? Discord: faeisnaxious#2673; email: adrianzabax@gmail.com
